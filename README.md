##Cookies
Express is a framework built on top of the Nodejs platform that enables developers to easily create routes and APIs for their servers. It is one of the most popular frameworks to date (with over 20,000 stars on github), and is used in companies such as Netflix and MySpace. It is centered around middleware - small pieces of code that are built to perform a specific task on the client's request. Being a framework, express only adds structure to Nodejs applications - you can still use native Nodejs code in your express applications.
